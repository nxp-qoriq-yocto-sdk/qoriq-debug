 User notes for qoriq-debug project.
************************************************************************************

The qoriq-debug project will perform out of source builds of Linux kernel modules
along with utility libraries and tools.

A pre-requisite for the module build is access to a configured Linux source tree.
This path to this source given to ./configure using the --with-linux option.

   --with-linux=DIR        path to Linux kernel src (default=/home/root/linux)

See ./configure --help for more options.
 
Build the tools using the normal Linux invocation

	./configure <additional options>
	make 
	make install
 
Note: At this time ONLY in source builds are available.
