qoriq-dbg Version 1.5

Introduction:

qoriq-dbg is a Linux kernel module which defines directories and files
in the virtual Linux debugfs file system.
These files are mapped to the various registers in the QorIQ debug IP.
The user sees a directory structure where using normal scripting tools one
can read and write "files" which result in the specific Debug IP registers being updated.

The effect of accessing these registers is immediate and interactive. 
This is useful as a experimenting tool for quickly discovering which registers
need to be programmed for a specific use case.
The use case itself can be written in any scripting/compiled language which can
perform file system operations.

Precondition:
This module will map the QorIQ Debug registers in the DCSR memory space into files
in the debugfs file system. The debugfs file system must be mounted on the target file system.

Edit /etc/fstab and add the line below.
debugfs /mnt/debugfs debugfs defaults 0 0

On target, execute:
	mount debugfs 

This version requires that the kernel contain device tree entries for the
DCSR based NPC trace buffer for that feature to be available.

Preferred Build Method:
To cross build from the host using the Makefile

Important! Edit the Makefile to change some hardcoded path values.

To cross build:
	make
	
To install:
	sudo make install  

On target:
execute this command after module (re-)installation.
	depmod -a 
	
execute to load the module:
	modprobe qoriq-dbg


Alternative Build Method: 
To build manually from the host execute the following commands.

Important! Change the paths to reflect your Linux source and rootfs paths.

make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- -C /path/to/linux M=$PWD modules
This will create the module (*.ko) in the source directory ($PWD).

e.g. make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- -C /home/user/bsp/ltib/rpm/BUILD/linux M=$PWD modules

To install into the rootfs

make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- -C /path/to/linux INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/path/to/rootfs M=$PWD modules_install
Installation default is in /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/extra, but must be prefixed with INSTALL_MOD_PATH
On target execute "depmod -a" to configure the modprobe config files.

e.g. make ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-linux-gnu- -C /home/user/bsp/ltib/rpm/BUILD/linux INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/srv/nfsroot/p4080 M=$PWD modules_install
